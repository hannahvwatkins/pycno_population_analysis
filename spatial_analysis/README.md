## *Pycnopodia helianthoides* spatial analysis and figure generation

**Author:** Steven Brownlee <br>

This folder contains the code and figures for the spatial analysis and mapping
porton of the the COSEWIC assessment of the status of *Pycnopodia helianthoides* 
in Canada. 

**Code and data**

The 'code' folder contains the script used to conduct the spatial analysis as well 
as a data dictionary outlining all of the datasets used. The data dictionary provides a description of all of the data used in the analysis and mapmaking process, with an eye to allowing the user the ability to recreate them and understand how the analysis code works. The data files 
and auxiliary datasets used in the analysis and mapmaking process are stored in the 'gis_files'
folder.

To run the analysis script, consult the data dictionary to gather up all of the required
files in a chosen folder then open the script. The script assumes no prior installation
of packages on the part of the user, and walks the user through preparing their own
R instance for the analysis process. 

**Figures**

The 'figures' folder contains all of the figures generated as a part of the spatial
analysis or otherwise referenced in the paper. Figure filenames should correspond
directly to those referenced in the manuscript, both in the analysis script used to 
generate them as well as the completed products.
